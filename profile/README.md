## The Vision

To help modern best practices become standard practice, across the software industry at large.

## The Mission

To make best practices tangible and accessible by housing production-quality, working demonstrations of software and infrastructure that the community can learn from, enhance, and use.

## Guiding Values

- ### Show, don't tell
  Best practices should be demonstrated through complete, working code setups.  
  Feedback must include clear, actionable methods for how to improve that code.

- ### Usability is expected
  All demonstrations should be applicable to at least a large portion of the community.  
  Community members should be able to use the code with as little friction as possible.

- ### Quality over speed
  Code must be production-quality, well-designed, proven to be working, and aligned with clearly supported best practices.  
  This project's development process is geared towards thoughtful demonstration of best practices, rather than moving fast. 

- ### Debate ideas, not people
  Discussion and debate are encouraged. The best answer wins.  
  Ad hominem arguments, or any form of asshole-ry, are not tolerated.

## Community Usage

This project is fully open source, and all code is freely usable and adaptable. See the LICENSE in each repository.

Each repository in this public organization houses one or more demonstrations of best practices.  
See the README in each repository for how to employ that code in your own projects or work.

## New Idea Proposals & Code Contribution Guidelines

Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING doc](../CONTRIBUTING.md). All repositories will also have a link to this doc when you submit your first PR.
